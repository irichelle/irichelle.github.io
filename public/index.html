      content= "My name is Irichelle Monterozo. Iâ€™m currently studying BS Accounting Information System in New Era University at Quezon City. I am looking for internship and part-time jobs related to my program that will help me gain experiences before I graduate. During my first year in college, I learned to use SAP Business One and gain a certificate for completing the training. In my free time I like watching tutorials and learning accounting softwares like Microsoft Excel, Xero, Quickbooks and Microsoft Dynamics NAV to gain edge from others as I don't have a lot of work experiences as they do.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
